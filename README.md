# Tutorial Portal
A simple portal written on top of the Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) framework for managing private tutorial sessions.

### Background
* Being a private Math tutor, I have been using the Notes app on my phone to record my students' attendance and payment record. It has been really troublesome and repetitive especially when I have to use lots of 'spaces' to format the lists and tables in the records.
* I have searched for tools and apps as I wished to find one that solves my problems, but there seemed not to be one that was free of charge.
* That is how I come up with the idea of creating an online portal for myself (and possibly other private tutors!)

### Features
* Accounts for admins (tutors) and students
* Admin:
    * Calendar view of weekly schedule
    * Student Manager - Attendance, Payment and student credentials management (of individual students)
    * View insights and analytics (with visual charts and numbers)
    
* Student:
    * View personal attendance and payment record

### Plan
* Complete implementation for personal use
* Tweak application such that it becomes easily deployable to everyone
* Include thorough documentations to guide app usage
